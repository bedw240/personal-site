	<p class="margin" style="font-size: 18x;">
	In Web Development I (CIS241) class, the exploration of HTML and CSS has been an enlightening journey that unveiled the foundations of creating visually appealing and structurally sound web pages.
	HTML is the framework of a webpage, understanding it's importance allowed me to learn its tags and elements to fully construct a webpage.
	From headings to lists, the versatility of HTML became apparent as I learned to organize and present content effectively.
	<br>
	CSS, on the other hand emerged as the artistic aesthetic, allowing me to style and design the elements created in HTML.
	Understanding the properties in CSS, and how to manipulate colors, fonts, and layouts is what leads to achieve a cohesive and pleasing design.
	This class has not only equipped me with technical skills but also instilled a creative perspective, empowering me to bring my ideas to life on the digital canvas.	
	<br><br>
	I've come to value problem-solving and patience as indispensable skills due to the complexity of coding and the challenges that require a methodical and patient approach.
	Patience, on the other hand, is the steady force that keeps me persistent in the face of coding puzzles and debugging.
